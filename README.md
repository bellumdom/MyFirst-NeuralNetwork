# MyFirst-NeuralNetwork
This is my first ever neural network. It takes a pattern of 3 1's and 0's which have an output answer the there patter, it then takes a new one which you enter and determines the output of that. 

What does it use: 
python3, a nueral network with just 5 inputs. Back propegation and Sigmoid functions

What was it made to do?

It comes with a trainer for the pattern of if 1 is the start of the sequence then 1 is the output and if 0 is the first number in the sequence then 0 will then be the output. 

But what if I want to change them?
there is a clear comment in the code of where the training inputs and outputs are. You don't need to know python to edit them.
